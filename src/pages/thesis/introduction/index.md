## Overview

Over the last two decades, technology has been transforming ways in
which teaching and learning are delivered to millions of learners around
the globe [@DigitalClassroomMarket] for both formal and non-formal
education and training. Many stakeholders, policy makers, and
researchers advocate education technology to improve experiences and
outcomes [@siemens2011LA; @Chasteen2011CourseTransf; @Ferguson2012LA].
Teachers are, however, the *front line end users*, who strive to
orchestrate technology needs and uses for both
inside [@Vermette2019TeachersDigitalClass] and
outside [@Hillman2019TeachersOutsideClass] classrooms, as well as to
harness data to improve teaching and learning [@TeachersAndData].

In face-to-face learning environments, teachers are, more or less,
skilled to grasp the classroom's climate. They frequently observe the
status of their living classroom. They can assess learners'
participation and involvement with the learning activities. They can
build an awareness of contingencies taking place at individual and group
levels. They can engage in formative interventions. They (re)scaffold,
(re)instruct, (re)explain parts and aspects of the materials gearing
lessons to successfully attain the learning
objectives [@Hattie2012VisibleLearningForTeacher, p. 81].

In online learning, the vital cues of co-located human interactions,
including facial expressions, direct contact, dialog with and feedback
from learners, among others, are to a large extent lacking. It can be
hard for teachers to build a strong emotional, social, and instructional
awareness of learners' online learning [@Jennings2009Prosocial].
Additionally, learners develop multifaceted behaviors online, including
different learning styles, acquisition, progression, pathways,
pacing [@Onah2014DropoutPatterns; @Lee2010DropoutReview]. Coupled with
the challenges of articulating both remote and co-located learning
activities [@Vermette2019TeachersDigitalClass; @Hillman2019TeachersOutsideClass],
it can be hard for teachers to acquire fine-grained knowledge about
learners' interactions with the online learning materials.

Education technology can yield large streams of information on a daily
basis, which can provide valuable insights into learners' behaviors,
processes, progress, and skills [@Siemens2013LA; @Siemens2012EDMAndLA].
Analyzing learning traces to inform day-to-day practices is, however,
both a complex and a laborious process [@Baker2014EDMAndLA]. Teachers
come up against barriers for using learning data in their schools. They
lack data, visual, and analytical literacy training to analyze, make
use, and sense of learning data [@Wasson2016TeacherDataLiteracy]. They
also lack formal time-slots for leveraging data-informed
practices [@TeachersAndData; @Sandford2006TeachingWGLoT]. There is a
growing need for tools that translate learning data into actionable
insights for teachers. *Information dashboards* can fill this gap.

Dashboards are now commonplace in
society [@Few2004DashConfusion; @Sarikaya2018DahsboardDesignSpace]. They
capitalize on our familiarity and experiences in using different
information-driven technologies for everyday use: phones, watches,
monitors, to name but a few. They present formative insights in a way
that facilitates at-a-glance readings. They can shape presentations to
fit a wide range of audiences. For teachers and learners alike,
dashboards seem promising tools to support a variety of practices on a
regular basis, such as monitoring learners [@Holstein2018AITeacher],
supporting learners with lesser abilities [@Molenaar2017TeacherARSI],
providing personalized support to learners in a timely
fashion [@Aslan2019SETA], and providing feedback to
learners [@Maldonado2015MTFeedback].

Recent research, however, underlines the lack of longitudinal research
examining the design, use, and impact of dashboards on teachers'
practices in "real-world"
settings [@Rodriguez2016MonitorAwareReflect; @Schwendimann2017DashReview; @Bodily2018LADashReview].
From a *design perspective*, Shum et al., argue for a growing
need for design-based research centered around needs of teachers and
learners in-situ to best serve pedagogical practices through
dashboards [@@Buckingham2019HCLA]. Verbert et al., argue the need for leveraging authentic and "richer set of relevant data" sources in education dashboards [@Verbert2014DashboardsReview]. Schwendimann et al., underline the need for examining dedicated designs that go beyond simple logs-driven summarization metrics in dashboards [@Schwendimann2017DashReview]. From an *empirical perspective*, several reviews of more than 150 dashboards underline the need for longitudinal field studies to better understand how teachers appropriate, leverage, and shape their pedagogical practices around dashboards in the long run [@Verbert2014DashboardsReview; @Schwendimann2017DashReview; @Bodily2018LADashReview]. From a *methodological perspective*, much work on teachers' dashboards remains somewhat disjoint. @Buckingham2019HCLA underline the need for
macro-conceptual implications covering the design space and accounting
for the interactions between underlying users and stakeholders. Ferguson highlights the importance of triangulating the social, pedagogical, and technical ramifications in the design and use of learning analytical technologies [@Ferguson2012LA].

This dissertation further examines teachers' dashboard design and use
in-the-wild. Specifically, it provides empirical findings from two
design and field studies on:

1.  Teachers' routines surrounding dashboards. We examine the benefits
    for teachers from using dashboards to improve learning experiences
    and outcomes of learners.

2.  Design and use implications of the social, pedagogical, and
    technical dimensions of dashboards. These implications can guide
    information-driven classroom technology and pedagogy.

## Thesis Statement

The use of learning technology brings forth both opportunities and
challenges. Such technologies often add more features, and tend not to
consider teachers' practices as much. From the learners' perspective,
they are often designed around "do your best". Teachers' dashboards can
bridge the gap between learning technology and pedagogy. We argue that
this research draws social, pedagogical, and technical implications. On
the one hand, to understand the social factors, we need a critical
inquiry into the pedagogical practices and the technical challenges
underpinned by teachers' dashboards. On the other hand, to properly
design such technologies, we need a profound understanding and
consideration of the social interactions of users.

## Research Approach

We conducted this thesis in the context of two commercial learning
platforms. Both platforms specialize in online language learning. is a
video-conferencing platform dedicated to improving oral communication
skills in a foreign language, English, French, and Spanish. Teachers use
to deliver virtual live classes to learners. is a web-based platform
dedicated to learning French vocabulary, grammar, and spelling concepts.
Teachers use to level up the writing skills of learners. Both platforms
are used by public/private schools, as well as professional teachers.
With we examined teachers' dashboards in a fully remote learning
setting. On the other hand, with we examined teachers' dashboards in a
blended setting where teachers articulate both face-to-face and remote
online learning. Together, both platforms provided us with interesting
contexts for examining the design and use of teachers' dashboards in
real-world learning settings.

We took an iterative mixed research approach and built upon research
from different fields, including social science, human-computer
interaction, human-centered design, information visualization, learning
analytics. Figure [1](#intro-fig-approach) illustrates the methodological, design,
and empirical approach of this thesis.

In the context of , teachers face one main challenge: lack of emotional
awareness in online learning, which is due to remote and
technology-mediated interactions. We built upon emotion models to
seamlessly incorporate, in the platform, cues to foster teachers'
awareness of learners' emotions. We then iteratively designed an
interactive dashboard, to support teachers' feedback reports, written to
learners after each live learning session.

In the context , teachers face one main challenge: lack of fine-grained
feedback about learners' interactions with online learning materials to
inform pedagogical interventions. We conducted a design
study [@Sedlmair2012DesignStudy] with teachers. We collaboratively
designed to assist teachers in bridging between learners' online
learning and data-informed pedagogical practices.

We built upon the results of our studies of and to drive the social
factors, pedagogical practices, and technical challenges intersecting
and interacting in the design and use of teachers'
dashboards [@Buckingham2019HCLA; @Ferguson2012LA].

We hope to contribute from three perspectives:

First, from a **design perspective**, we designed, implemented, and
deployed two fully functioning teachers-centered dashboards in
real-world settings, to study teachers' dashboards in-situ:

-   Emodash, a dashboard designed based on interviews with five teachers and
    one learner and refined through an iterative design process, to
    facilitate teachers' retrospective awareness of learners' emotions,
    and support teachers' writing of reinforcement feedback reports to
    learners after video-conferencing language learning sessions.

-   Progdash, a dashboard designed based on interviews with seven teachers and
    refined through collaborative design prototypes, to bridge between
    learners' use of an online grammar learning platform and teachers'
    data-informed pedagogical practices.

Second, from an **empirical perspective**, we designed and conducted
qualitative and quantitative analyses to distill empirical evidence to
both inform the design and assess the impact of our built artifacts with
respect to teachers' needs and practices:

-   We conducted several informal discussions with designers of two
    online language learning platforms to understand the pedagogical
    challenges of teachers when using such platforms, as well as their
    inner working.

-   We conducted several formal interviews with teachers to understand
    their needs, challenges, and pedagogical practices through which
    they aim to influence and reinforce learners' learning.

-   We designed and conducted two of the first design studies and
    in-the-wild longitudinal field studies, lasting two and three
    months, respectively, to study how 34 teachers from both studies,
    make use and sense of dashboards to inform their pedagogical
    practices.

-   We conducted several formal post-interviews with teachers to
    evaluate and report on the usefulness, effectiveness, and impact of
    our artifacts on teachers' everyday practices.

-   We conducted a qualitative and quantitative exploratory analysis
    comparing learners' inferred emotions from two different modalities,
    namely audio and video streams.

-   We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis comparing
    teachers' written feedback reports *with* and *without* ; and also
    to articulate teachers' pedagogical practices when using .

And finally, from a **methodological perspective**, we built upon a
broad spectrum of research theories, methods, and studies to both inform
the design and assess the use of teachers' dashboards in context:

-   We built upon emotion recognition theories and studies from
    psychology [@ekman1976ediscrete; @feldman1998edimentional] to
    ground, capture, quantify, and integrate cues [@DMello2017ELA] to
    foster teachers' awareness of learners' emotions in online learning
    environments.

-   We proposed a method to unify discrete and dimensional models of
    emotions to make it easier to combine and use them in a multimodal
    fashion [@Ezzaouia2017Emoda].

-   We conducted an exploratory analysis of more than 7 hours'
    recordings to compare learners' inferred emotions from two different
    modalities: audio and video streams, when using video-conferencing
    learning sessions.

-   We conducted an exploratory analysis of more than 10 hours' screen
    recordings to examine teachers' experience when writing feedback
    reports with the use of .

-   We conducted a qualitative thematic
    analysis [@Braun2006ThematicAnalysis] of interviews to assess the
    impact of both studies of and .

-   We conducted a quantitative non-parametric factorial
    analysis [@Wobbrock2016NonparametricStats] to compare teachers'
    written feedback reports *with* and *without* the use of .

-   We proposed design implications that triangulate the social,
    pedagogical, and technical dimensions underpinned by teachers'
    dashboards.

## Thesis Outline

In Chapter 3, we examine multimodal and contextual awareness cues of learners'
emotions for teachers' uses. We present a case study of learners'
emotional cues. We apply two theoretical models of emotion: discrete and
dimensional. We demonstrate this approach in the context of . We propose
to infer emotions from the audio and video streams of the live learning
session, along with learners' self-reported emotions. We contextualize
emotional cues using teachers' and learners' traces on the platform.

In Chapter 4, we examine the impact of learners' emotions awareness dashboard on
teachers' written feedback reports. We present a design and longitudinal
field study of . We designed based on interviews with five teachers. We
refined the design through an iterative design process. We evaluated its
impact through a two-month field study with five professional teachers
and five learners.

In Chapter 5, we examine the impact of learners' progression dashboard on
teachers' pedagogical practices. We present a design and longitudinal
field study of . We designed based on interviews with seven teachers. We
collaboratively iterated and refined the design through informal
discussions with teachers and designers of the platform. We evaluated
its impact through a three-month field study with 29 teachers from
middle, high, and vocational schools, and university.

In Chapter 6, we articulate the social factors, the pedagogical practices, and
the technical challenges of the design and use of teachers' dashboards.
We engaged with these three dimensions, to examine the opportunities and
challenges that we may face in the development of teachers' dashboards.
Together, these dimensions serve as a conceptual umbrella for the design
of information-driven technologies and macro-implications for dashboards
fitting teachers' and learners' everyday situations and contexts.
