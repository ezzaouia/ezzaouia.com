For so long, I have been procrastinating about building my website. Hoping for a career in academia, the personal website seems more mandatory than it might be in other domains. Truth to be told, I have seen so many personal web pages of many researchers. Exploring a wide range of such exemplars did not, however, catalyze my motivation to build one for myself. This is attributed to two related reasons. One is that I didn‚Äôt fall in love with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, and such, the horsepowers behind plenty of static web pages in academia. The second is that I love and use modern javascript libraries, such as <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, and <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a>. I use these libraries for all my research and side projects. I was looking for a ‚Äúclean‚Äù stack to ensure a seamless experience with the tools that I enjoy and that I‚Äôm already familiar with.

Recently, I landed on <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> which is a modern web pages generator based on <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> and <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a>. In other words, **Gatsby** leverage the power of static web pages and <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> ecosystem to build incredibly fast websites and even apps. What does that even mean? Well, it means that we can create predictable <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> components to (re)use in our website, write our contents in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank">markdown</a>, and use <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> to fetch any type of data, resources, medias, including **markdown**, in our components. Not only that, but **Gatsby** comes with tons of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/" target="_blank">plugins</a> to read and transform all types of contents in a website to almost any shape, forme, and size.

As I was really lazy about this project, even after skimming the documentation of **Gatsby** and grasping its power. I wasn't ready to start building my website from scratch. I instead googled a combination of keywords, e.g.,  **Gatsby**, **React**, **Personal website**, **Starter üòÇ**. "Starter" was an important one! Fast forward, I stumbled upon <a href="https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.app/" target="_blank">blog starter</a> by Gatsby. Further research led me to a fork of Gatsby's starter by <a href="https://overreacted.io/" target="_blank">Dan Abramov</a> for his blog, Dan is a very active person in React community and develops React at Facebook, to say the least. 

Now, you might guessed it? That's right! I forked Dan's blog and started from there. I want to keep this article as an intro. I'll keep all the detail for an upcoming article. If you are interested to know a bit more about inner details, my <a href="https://github.com/ezzaouia/ezzaouia.com">website</a> is open-source on GitHub.
