[WIP!!]

Preparing and giving talks to different audiences is an important skill to master in one's professional career. A Ph.D. candidate is no exception. And, it is more likely to happen once in one's lifetime. We spent years doing heavy work. We want to get a defense right. *How to go around preparing for such two hours plus defense?* The good news is that the setting of a Ph.D. defense is more controllable than an "open" presentation. The most important audience in a Ph.D. defense is the committee members. So let's focus on them. When we look closer, we might find out that the preparation boils down to one main question: 

> *What the committee members are looking for the most?*

Let's break down this question. From a committee member perspective, a Ph.D. defense is both an *assessment* and an *investment*. It is an assessment in sense of a canonical service that a researcher in academia provides to the community. At the same time, it is an investment as it provides a great opportunity for a committee member to grasp and discuss a research topic (often) related to their research interest, which may help spark new ideas. The state of mind of a committee member is, therefore, gravitating around two main objectives: conducting an assessment of the research work at hand and maximizing the return on investment. From a Ph.D. candidate perspective, we need to optimize our talk to address both of these fronts.

With these materials as background, we can now narrow down our initial question into at least six main themes. Such themes articulate what the committee members' aim is all about. Before delving into what, let's first highlight what is not their aim. **Perfection** is surprisingly not something that the committee members are looking for. Every research work is limited. A Ph.D. dissertation is no exception. When we flip, however, *perfection*, we might find out: *mistakes*, *drifts*, *reorientations*, *issues*, *glitches*, *tradeoffs*, and so on. A Ph.D. work has many "flaws". We want to make sure that we did a deep reflection on these ahead of time. So we will get back to them as well.

## What the committee members are looking for the most:
**A solid grasp of**:

> 1. Research topic and it ramifications
> 1. What was done
> 1. What was found
> 1. What limitations
> 1. What implications
> 1. What next

Alright, there is one more preliminary step to tackle here. Remember the textbook mantra: *no your audience*. As a Ph.D. candidate, we may be aware of the research work of the committee members. Sometimes, however, for some reason, we might end up landing on committee members that were off our radar, or we are not fully aware of their research. In this case, as a preliminary first step, we want to go ahead and grasp our committee members' research background, work, and interest. Remember the two main objectives of a committee member: assessment and return on investment. It is very easy for people to frame/connect their interactions with their familiar ground of interest. Our discussions, comments, and questions are to a great extent informed from and derived by our familiarities.
