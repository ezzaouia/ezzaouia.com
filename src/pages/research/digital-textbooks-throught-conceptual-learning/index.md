## 🖐️ The big picture

Digital textbooks are very different from the traditional printed ones that we are used to. They are living species as they can be updated regularly to best serve the needs. They leverage new ways and experiences of content reading. They provide flexibility and interactivity to navigate and process different blocks of information.  They allow personalized learning paths. They provide rich contents by linking different media and sources of information.

> *Can we effectively foster digital textbooks reading through conceptual learning?*

I'll study this question as part of my postdoc starting mid September 2020 \[...]. I'll examine studying and designing conceptual learning techniques to foster textbooks’ reading.
