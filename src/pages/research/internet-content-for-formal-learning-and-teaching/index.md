## 🖐️ The big picture

The use of the internet for education is now widespread in society. Learning and teaching is no longer bounded with physical classrooms. Million of users engage with online materials on Youtube, Medium, Wikipedia, Stackoverflow, Reddit, to name but a few, to learn and teach a wide range of topics on a daily basis. Users also engage the most with online contents using multiple devices including, smart-phones, smart-watches, tablets, to name but a few. 

> *Can we leverage the internet content for formal learning and teaching?* 

I'm examining this question with the goal to study and design tools to help people learn English as a second language, or other STEM concepts. My goal is to *augment* the internet, e.g., YouTube videos, with other devices and/or tangible objects, such as smartphones, smartwatches, amazon echo, with which one can engage, for instance, in role-play conversations.
